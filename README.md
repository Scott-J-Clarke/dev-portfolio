# dev-portfolio

## Description

The main purpose of this portfolio is to display my coding projects. 

It was built with React and JavaScript. Tailwind was used for styling.

I have linked six projects:

- "Daily Dose of Tech" is a blog-style, full stack web application, using the MVC framework
- "Note Taker" is meant for a user to write, save, and review notes
- "Logo Generator" lets a user make a customized logo
- "What's the Weather?" informs users about weather conditions around the world
- "Working Day Calendar" allows a user to track and tackle their daily to-do list
- "Social Network API" is the backend of a basic social media application

Through building this portfolio, I:

- gained experience using Tailwind
- better understand how React components work
- utilized Chat GPT to create a web responsive application

## Future Development

This portfolio is far from complete! Here's what I'll keep working on:

- add sunrise image at the top of 'AboutPage.jsx' (or in 'Header.jsx')
- use { Link } from 'react-router-dom' to create smoother transitions
- credit all 6 of the 'Unsplash' images used on 'PortfolioPage.jsx'
- create two buttons for each image on 'PortfolioPage.jsx', one for its GitHub repo, one for its 'demo'
- search 'Formik' for a pre-made 'Contact Me' form that can be implemented in 'ContactPage.jsx' 
- put in 'mailto' on 'ContactPage.jsx' so that the message is actually sent to me
- design a 'Copyright' at the bottom of the portfolio page
